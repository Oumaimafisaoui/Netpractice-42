## What's an IP adresse?
> An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network. Computers use IP addresses to communicate with each other both over the internet as well as on other networks.

## What's a Network?
> A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

## What's a TCP/IP?
> TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on a network.
## What's a subnet mask?
>  The subnet mask is used by the TCP/IP protocol to determine whether a host is on the local subnet or on a remote network.

## Why using routers?

> If a TCP/IP computer needs to communicate with a host on another network, it will usually communicate through a device called a router. In TCP/IP terms, a router that is specified on a host, which links the host's subnet to other networks, is called a default gateway. This section explains how TCP/IP determines whether or not to send packets to its default gateway to reach another computer or device on the network.

<ul>
<li>In this level, we should know the private IP adress : A private IP address is a range of non-internet facing IP addresses used in an internal network.</li>
<p>Address ranges to be use by private networks are:</p>

<li>Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255</li>
<li>Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255</li>
<li>Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255</li>
<br>
<p>The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special-purpose IPv4 address and is called the localhost or loopback address. All computers use this address as their own, but it doesn't let computers communicate with other devices as a real IP address does.</p>

<li>A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.</li>
